Recently, microbial degradation of (micro)plastics has gained widespread attention because of its green and sustainable properties. Microbial degradation of (micro)plastics is based on the cascade effects of various enzymes secreted by microorganisms, which can convert (micro)plastics into oligomers and monomers, or even mineralize them into CO2 and H2O. The microbial degradation of (micro)plastics is affected by multiple factors, such as microbial species, plastic properties, and environmental conditions. Currently, limited efficient plastic-degrading microorganisms have been discovered, and their degradation mechanisms are still unclear. Furthermore, the efficiency of microbial degradation needs to be improved for future application. Therefore, this review systematically summarizes the sources and properties of existing plastics, identifies pure cultures and mixed cultures for plastic degradation, and examines their influencing factors. In particular, the microbial degradation behaviors of (micro)plastics, including relevant enzymes, degradation efficiency, and degradation mechanisms, were thoroughly discussed. Additionally, the augmentation technologies coupling with microbial degradation, such as advanced oxidation, electrochemical, and genetic engineering technologies, were introduced and highlighted for their potential prospects. This review provides a reference for future research and development of (micro)plastic biodegradation technology.",

Recently, microbial degradation of (micro)plastics has gained widespread attention because of its green and sustainable properties. Microbial degradation of (micro)plastics is based on the cascade effects of various enzymes secreted by microorganisms, which can convert (micro)plastics into oligomers and monomers, or even mineralize them into CO2 and H2O.

      "subject": "Plastic wastes, widely distributed in the environment, can be transformed into microplastics, posing a huge threat to ecosystems and human health due to their stability and adsorbability to other toxic pollutants (e.g., heavy metals and antibiotics). Recently, microbial degradation of (micro)plastics has gained widespread attention because of its green and sustainable properties. Microbial degradation of (micro)plastics is based on the cascade effects of various enzymes secreted by microorganisms, which can convert (micro)plastics into oligomers and monomers, or even mineralize them into CO2 and H2O. The microbial degradation of (micro)plastics is affected by multiple factors, such as microbial species, plastic properties, and environmental conditions. Currently, limited efficient plastic-degrading microorganisms have been discovered, and their degradation mechanisms are still unclear. Furthermore, the efficiency of microbial degradation needs to be improved for future application. Therefore, this review systematically summarizes the sources and properties of existing plastics, identifies pure cultures and mixed cultures for plastic degradation, and examines their influencing factors. In particular, the microbial degradation behaviors of (micro)plastics, including relevant enzymes, degradation efficiency, and degradation mechanisms, were thoroughly discussed. Additionally, the augmentation technologies coupling with microbial degradation, such as advanced oxidation, electrochemical, and genetic engineering technologies, were introduced and highlighted for their potential prospects. This review provides a reference for future research and development of (micro)plastic biodegradation technology.",
